# README

MATLAB code for parameter estimation of thymocytes TECs population dynamics model descripted in the paper "Quantitative
Analysis Reveals Reciprocal Regulations Underlying Recovery Dynamics of Thymocytes and Thymic Environment in Mice". 

## System requirements

The code was developed using MATLAB R2018a, and requires Optimization Toolbox.

## Instructions for use

Run each file in the `main/` directory to execute parameter estimation. Bootstrap estimation (`main_bootstrap.m`) takes several hours on a desktop computer. The result is saved in the `params` folder.
